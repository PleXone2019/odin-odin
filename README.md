# ODIN: Open Data INitiative
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gcba-odin/odin.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/gcba-odin/odin) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a61e5f13c19c43c099202315ce753d71)](https://www.codacy.com/app/ODIN/odin?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=gcba-odin/odin&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) [![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


ODIN is an API first open source DMS (data management system) created to help governments publish and share their data.

It takes in CSV, XLS and XLSX files and exposes them in a paginated REST API. The associated metadata is also available, with search and filter capabilities.

The UI is kept in two separate projects (Angular.js 1.x clients):

1.  [Admin](https://github.com/gcba-odin/odin-admin)
2.  [Frontend](https://github.com/gcba-odin/odin-frontend)

The authentication, ACL, rate-limiting, CORS and related features must be handled by a [Kong](https://getkong.org/) instance.

**ODIN is currently under heavy development, and is not recommended for production use. You are welcome to contribute.**

## Requirements

ODIN is a Node.js app, built on top of the [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/) framework.

It uses two databases: a relational one for storing metadata, and a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for storing the file contents. As with any Sails app, you can use whatever relational database you wish, as long as there's a [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline) connector for it. The default is PostgreSQL, and its Waterline connector comes preinstalled.

Currently there's no support for other NoSQL databases.

So, all in all you'll need:

- Node.js 5.12
- A relational database (PostgreSQL 9.5)
- MongoDB 3.2.x

ODIN has not been tested with earlier versions of Node.js and MongoDB.

## How to install

1. Clone the repo

``` bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/gcba-odin/odin.git
```

2. Instalar las dependencias

```bash
  $ cd odin
  $ npm install
```

3. Crear la base de datos en postgres: nombre de la db `odin`, password `postgres`

4. Ajustar las configuraciones de `config/odin.js` segÃºn gusto y necesidad

5. Iniciar la app

``` bash
  $ npm start
```

## PostgreSQL
Ubuntu instructions:
```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

For more information visit the PostgreSQL [oficial page](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Kong

1. Install kong according their [web page](https://getkong.org/) instructions (depending on OS)

   Ubuntu instructions:

```bash
    1. Download the package from https://getkong.org/install/ubuntu/#packages
    2. sudo apt-get update
    3. sudo apt-get install netcat openssl libpcre3 dnsmasq procps
    4. sudo dpkg -i kong-0.8.3.*.deb
```

2. Create the postgres database: db name: `kong`, password `postgres`

3. Load the database dump

4. Move the configuration file `kong.yml` on `/etc/kong`

5. Modify `kong.yml` configurations according needs

6. Start  Kong

   ```bash
    $ sudo kong start
   ```

## Configuration

You should override the corresponding settings in the 'local.js' file
```javascript
module.exports.odin = {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // --> Url where the api is hosted
    kongHost: 'http://kongexample.com', // --> Url where kong is hosted
    kongAdmin: 'http://kongexample.com:8001', // --> Kong port to acces configurations

    uploadFolder: 'files', // --> Path to the folder where the datasets files will be stored
    datasetZipFolder: 'datasets', // --> Path where the datasets zips will be stored

    defaultEncoding: 'utf8',
    dataStorage: {  //--> NoSql database host and port
        host: 'localhost',
        port: '27017'
    },
    logFile: 'sailsApp.log', // --> File name and path of the log file
    logFolder: 'logs', // --> Folder where the logs will be saved
